Results driven Information Security Leader | Innovator | Speaker

Information Security and Technology Leader with extensive experience developing information security programs, building highly functional teams, and security change leadership. 

Over the past 25+ years, I have worked through many IT and security evolutionary trends while learning different ways to evaluate, understand, and remediate cybersecurity risks. As an expert in information security and application security governance, I have written several articles and contributed to the current security standards, taking advantage of the latest advances in application development and cloud computing.

I am a frequent presenter at national and international conferences on topics ranging from advanced security and governance to application security and the evolution of the security industry as a whole.
