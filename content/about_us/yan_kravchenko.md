Results driven Information Security Leader | Innovator | Speaker

Over the past 25+ years, I have worked through many IT and security evolutionary trends while learning different ways to evaluate, understand, and remediate cybersecurity risks. As an expert in information security and application security governance, I have written several articles and contributed to the current security standards, taking advantage of the latest advances in application development and cloud computing.
